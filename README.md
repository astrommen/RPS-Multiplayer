    - position of boxes start & end
    - Player input box (only 2)
        - with start button

        - change initial top text with user input

  * 1 box (win/lose condition)
    - Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. 
    - After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.


  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.
    - change both bottom of boxes

  * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent. 
    - Not sure how to do this yet

  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

  * Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.
